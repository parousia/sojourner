"You and your friend, Hopeful, start walking through Enchanted Ground that begins to make you both
very drowsy. To keep yourselves awake, you decide to keep talking with each other and ask Hopeful
how God was first introduced in his life. Hopeful, who lived in the sinful town Vanity, indulged in
 all the treasures and riches of this world including rebelling, partying, drinking, swearing,
 lying, and lewdness."
