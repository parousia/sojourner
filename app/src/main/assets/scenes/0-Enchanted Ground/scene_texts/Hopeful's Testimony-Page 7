"With that, Faithful only asked Hopeful and try to meet Him himself by praying. So Hopeful
 prayed hundreds of times without any revelation of Christ, but didnâ€™t stop, because he thought
 that only the righteousness of Christ could save him. Moreover, if he stopped praying, he would
 die and he sought to die at the throne of grace."
